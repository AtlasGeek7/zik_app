Hello and welcome to Zik App:  my first Ruby CLI application. This is also my very first portfolio project as a Flatiron Bootcamp student.
It uses Ruby OOP and Nokogiri/Open-URI gems for the purpose of scraping a website in search of some music list info. The website link is: 
https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/?list_page=10#list-item-50

The app displays 50 songs of their top-500 list of the greatest songs in history. Songs can be displayed in one whole list or 
searched by title, band, or rank.

Hopefully you find this basic app of mine kind of useful. Thanks for visiting!
